# ABP Cursor Rules

A collection of Cursor.ai rules designed to enhance productivity when working with ABP Framework projects. These rules help streamline development workflows and provide intelligent assistance for ABP-specific patterns and practices.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

This is a new, experimental project that is currently in its early stages. The rules have been created using AI and extensive documentation research, but they haven't been fully tested in major ABP projects yet. This repository serves as a starting point, and we hope that the community will help enhance and improve these rules over time through real-world usage and contributions.

### Current Limitations
Currently, the rules primarily focus on MVC Razor Pages as the UI platform. We welcome contributions for other UI platforms.  If you're working with any of these platforms, your contributions would be greatly appreciated to expand the rules' coverage.
